                         <h6 style="line-height: 35px;">There's this story of mine that looks touching but educating... <br><br> in 2016 i started my phones and gadgets accessories business with #20,000. I was doing the business the normal way, always making sales and even giving myself the best treat...All these without a store because I was just starting out. <br><br> Later in 2017 I got a store from the money I saved, the business got me a lot of profit to get my own space and continue marketing since it's the only option I have to make a living. The positive result from the business kept me moving and advancing towards expanding the business to make more money for myself and gain brand recognition. During this process I wasn't running advert for my business, I got my store stocked it with lots of goods and everything was doing well and fine. <br><br> A tragedy happened November 18, 2017 which led to my store getting burnt as a result of carelessness from one of the store owner in the market. This occurrence was the saddest thing that has ever happened in my life and also led me back to my starting point and made me broke and frustrated. I made up my mind to continue the hardwork and business as a phase of my life...
 <br><br> Fast forward to 2018 around January the remaining of my store I was looking forward to return to got demolished by the governor due to the fact it was near the road life goes on with the struggle so I had to go back to using wheelbarrow to market my remaining accessories... Life on the street starts getting hard for me again but I never had any better business in mind to replace the business... <br><br> Lots of people feel comfortable with their current state of life and never looking for alternative...I went through all these hardship for long because I felt the business is the best I can do...The fear and procastination to get my hands to other business led to me getting broke and unable to feed my family then the next wave hit me... <br><br>
 <br><br> On February 2018 my Dad fell seriously sick which as the breadwinner of the family I need to look for all successful means to get him treated by borrowing money since I'm not financially fit to raise high amount of money for his surgeries then my dad died on 5th of July 2018 after 2 unsuccessful surgeries which costs #290,000 and #450,000 respectively which I was unable to get. <br><br> There's a reason I'm telling you these things because I know the implications of not having money or being broke. If you are someone that need turn around in your life for good then don't skip any part of this message. <br><br> I sold everything I had plus my savings to make sure he gets a befitting burial as the Igbo demands. He was buried successfully August 17 that same year. <br><br>September 2018 started life again from the scratch. Hustle begins in the street frustrated and stressful again...I have prayed to God to skip the stage of my life because everything seems not to be working anymore. Then I discovered that prayer without the right information and the right set of people won't take me anywhere. This stage I want a change in my life but yet to know where to start from. <br><br> On a Saturday morning, my mom called me to inform me about my only sister who was in 200level in a university in the east pursuing her degree in Mass communication would have to drop out because of finance to continue with her education. But I urge her not to take drastic step as I vowed to do all my best to make my sister graduate. At this stage I had to work harder than I used to. <br><br> <b class="red-text">"Procastination and fear is the friend of every coward, Time is what the genius pays for..."</b> <br><br> 2019 I started saving up again from my small business and paid my sister’s tuition fee and other family responsibilities started showing up... this time I had to spend 5x and work 10x than before... <br><br> <b class="red-text"> "If you are born poor, it's not your fault but if you die poor your generation would suffer for it and you'd also be blamed for it" </b> <br><br> 2020 I was enthusiastic to grow my business and I started saving up to grow my business again and cover up for the lost...My attempt doing this another wave of pandemic hit the country. <br><br>2020 March corona outbreak I started thinking about what to do and was always online anytime am less busy. <br><br>Due to my curiosity to find something worthwhile to do online I got scammed and lossed over #80,000 to scammers online around April and May 2020 <br><br>I stop anything online due to the fall to scammers and faced my business I was lot discouraged about doing any business online due to my experience. <br><br>I was able to save up some money got a location and built a container so I can make sales but i was not satisfied with the results i was getting. <br><br>Then I jumped online again to see if I can get something worthwhile doing online but up to no vail. <br><br>A month later after I couldn’t find something good doing online one of my mentor messaged me on WhatsApp if I would be interested in doing some affiliate marketing and I said yes after he explained in details and sent me video and confirmations from people who have been successful through affiliate marketing and I registered. <br><br>After registering and gone through the 72ig course with Toyin Omotosho, I applied the formula shared in my the course and my business have moved from small scale to 6 figures in 3months. Then my journey as an online marketer started... After the pandemic I implemented all I learnt from online affiliation to my offline business then I was able to recover all my lost funds within 8 months of being a marketer.... <br><br><b> MORAL LESSON: INVEST IN YOURSELF AND LEARN TO ACQUIRE DIGITAL SKILLS.</b> <br><br></h6>
